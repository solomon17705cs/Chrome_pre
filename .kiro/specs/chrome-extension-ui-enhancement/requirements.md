# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the user interface and user experience of an existing Chrome Extension AI Assistant to create a more professional, modern, and polished appearance. The extension currently provides AI-powered chat, summarization, writing, and rewriting capabilities through Chrome's built-in AI APIs. The backend functionality is complete and should remain untouched, with all improvements focused on the visual design, layout, interactions, and overall user experience.
