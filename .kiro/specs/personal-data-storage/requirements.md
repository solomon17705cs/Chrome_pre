# Personal Data Storage and Retrieval System Requirements

## Introduction

This feature implements a personal data storage and retrieval system that automatically extracts, stores, and utilizes personal information shared during conversations to create a more personalized and context-aware AI experience. The system will remember user details, preferences, events, and other personal information to provide more relevant and personalized responses.

## Glossary

- **Personal_Data_Manager**: The core system component responsible for extracting, storing, and managing personal information
- **Data_Extraction**: The process of identifying and parsing personal information from user messages
- **Context_Enhancement**: Adding stored personal information to AI prompts for more personalized responses
- **Local_Storage**: Browser-based storage mechanism for persisting personal data
- **Data_Categories**: Organized groupings of personal information (personal, work, preferences, events, etc.)
- **Memory_System**: The overall mechanism for storing and retrieving conversation history and extracted data

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI to automatically detect and store personal information I share in conversations, so that it can remember details about me for future interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a message containing personal information, THE Personal_Data_Manager SHALL extract relevant data using pattern matching
2. THE Personal_Data_Manager SHALL categorize extracted data into predefined categories (personal, work, preferences, events, goals, family, health)
3. THE Personal_Data_Manager SHALL store extracted data in Local_Storage for persistence across sessions
4. THE Personal_Data_Manager SHALL display a notification when new personal data is detected and stored
5. THE Personal_Data_Manager SHALL prevent duplicate storage of identical information

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI to use my stored personal information to provide more relevant and personalized responses, so that conversations feel more natural and contextual.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a message, THE Personal_Data_Manager SHALL generate relevant context from stored personal data
2. THE Personal_Data_Manager SHALL append personal context to the user's message before sending to the AI model
3. THE Personal_Data_Manager SHALL prioritize recent and relevant information for context generation
4. THE Personal_Data_Manager SHALL limit context size to prevent overwhelming the AI model
5. THE Personal_Data_Manager SHALL maintain conversation flow without exposing internal data management processes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view, manage, and control my stored personal data, so that I have full transparency and control over what information is remembered.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Personal_Data_Manager SHALL provide a user interface for viewing all stored personal data
2. THE Personal_Data_Manager SHALL organize data display by categories with clear labeling
3. THE Personal_Data_Manager SHALL provide functionality to export personal data as a JSON file
4. THE Personal_Data_Manager SHALL provide functionality to import personal data from a JSON file
5. THE Personal_Data_Manager SHALL provide functionality to clear all stored personal data with confirmation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want my personal data to be stored securely and privately, so that my information remains confidential and under my control.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Personal_Data_Manager SHALL store all data locally in the user's browser using Local_Storage
2. THE Personal_Data_Manager SHALL never transmit personal data to external servers or services
3. THE Personal_Data_Manager SHALL provide clear indicators when personal data is being processed
4. THE Personal_Data_Manager SHALL allow users to opt-out of data collection at any time
5. THE Personal_Data_Manager SHALL implement data retention limits to prevent excessive storage accumulation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to intelligently extract different types of personal information, so that it can remember various aspects of my life and preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Personal_Data_Manager SHALL extract basic personal information (name, age, location, occupation, contact details)
2. THE Personal_Data_Manager SHALL extract preferences and opinions (likes, dislikes, favorites)
3. THE Personal_Data_Manager SHALL extract events and appointments (meetings, deadlines, birthdays)
4. THE Personal_Data_Manager SHALL extract work-related information (company, projects, colleagues)
5. THE Personal_Data_Manager SHALL extract goals and aspirations (learning objectives, future plans)

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive feedback when the system learns something new about me, so that I'm aware of what information is being stored and can correct any misunderstandings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new personal data is extracted, THE Personal_Data_Manager SHALL display a non-intrusive notification
2. THE Personal_Data_Manager SHALL show what specific information was learned in the notification
3. THE Personal_Data_Manager SHALL provide quick access to the full data management interface from notifications
4. THE Personal_Data_Manager SHALL auto-dismiss notifications after a reasonable time period
5. THE Personal_Data_Manager SHALL allow users to dismiss notifications manually

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to maintain a history of our conversations while respecting storage limitations, so that context can be maintained over time without consuming excessive resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Personal_Data_Manager SHALL store conversation history with timestamps
2. THE Personal_Data_Manager SHALL implement automatic cleanup of old conversation data
3. THE Personal_Data_Manager SHALL prioritize recent conversations for context generation
4. THE Personal_Data_Manager SHALL limit total storage size to prevent browser performance issues
5. THE Personal_Data_Manager SHALL provide statistics on data usage and storage consumption
