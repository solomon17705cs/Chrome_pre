# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the presentation mode in the AIO Chrome Extension to display slides in visually distinct boxes with blue line separators, similar to the existing roadmap feature design. Currently, the presentation mode displays content as plain formatted markdown, but users need a more structured and visually appealing slide-by-slide presentation format.

## Glossary

- **AIO_Extension**: The main Chrome extension application that provides multiple content generation modes
- **Presentation_Mode**: The current powerpoint/slides mode that generates slide content via AI
- **Slide_Container**: Individual visual containers that will hold each slide's content
- **Blue_Line_Separator**: The visual design element (left border) that distinguishes each slide container
- **Slide_Parser**: The component that processes AI-generated slide content into individual slides

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user generating presentations, I want each slide to be displayed in a separate visual container, so that I can easily distinguish between different slides.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects presentation mode and generates content, THE AIO_Extension SHALL display each slide in a separate Slide_Container
2. WHEN slide content is parsed, THE Slide_Parser SHALL identify individual slides based on "SLIDE X:" markers
3. WHEN displaying slides, THE AIO_Extension SHALL maintain the existing slide numbering and title structure
4. WHEN no slide markers are found, THE AIO_Extension SHALL fall back to displaying the content as formatted markdown
5. WHEN slide content is empty or malformed, THE AIO_Extension SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user viewing generated slides, I want each slide container to have a blue line separator on the left side, so that the presentation has a consistent and professional visual appearance similar to the roadmap feature.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying slides, THE AIO_Extension SHALL apply a blue left border to each Slide_Container
2. WHEN styling slide containers, THE AIO_Extension SHALL use the same blue color (#2563eb) as the roadmap feature
3. WHEN rendering slide containers, THE AIO_Extension SHALL apply consistent padding, margins, and background styling
4. WHEN displaying multiple slides, THE AIO_Extension SHALL maintain consistent spacing between Slide_Container elements
5. WHEN slides contain titles, THE AIO_Extension SHALL style slide titles with the same blue color as the border

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user working with presentation content, I want the slide containers to integrate seamlessly with the existing UI, so that the presentation mode feels consistent with other content generation modes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying slides, THE AIO_Extension SHALL maintain compatibility with the existing export to Google Slides functionality
2. WHEN slides are rendered, THE AIO_Extension SHALL preserve all existing slide content formatting within each container
3. WHEN switching between modes, THE AIO_Extension SHALL properly clear and re-render content without visual artifacts
4. WHEN slides contain bullet points or structured content, THE AIO_Extension SHALL maintain proper markdown formatting within each container
5. WHEN the presentation mode is active, THE AIO_Extension SHALL show the export to slides button as it currently does
